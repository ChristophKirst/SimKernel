Todo:


general reorganization:

- improve pattern matching / kernel -> in particular make clear distinction between parser / kernel etc...



- have different scopes that are evaluated at different stages of the iteraton process:
      i.e. Init`  -> evaluated at first init form master process
           InitIter` -> evaluated at initialization of next iteration
           EndIter` -> at end of iteration 
           End` -> at end of full simulation

         -> this allows for iteration dependent extra output via Print[] or other routines
         -> with filemanagement routines this allows for combining files at the end of simulation etc...
           
- result dependent choice of next iteration 
           via NextIteration` scope 
            -> which can be set by default to IncreaseIteration
   -> it is no longer clear how many iterations we have !! -> so take care about this too !!!



- features:

   - file manipulation expressions, file joins 
   - CMMFile interface -> maybe have a join command for joining binaryfiles to a larger one ? -> need file end identifier !!
         -> should work
   - include header files / Include["aasdad"]  



-> probably requires a larger rewrite !!!
